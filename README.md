# ABSTRACT:
Farmers need to predict soil nutrient levels to optimize crop productivity and ensure a surplus of high-quality crops, especially with the increasing demand for food and growing population. This requires advanced technologies to assist farmers in monitoring their crops and making informed decisions about crop management practices.To address this need, smart agro devices have been developed with IoT sensors that can measure key soil criterion such as moisture content, torridity, pH levels, and nutritional levels. These devices send soil-related information to farmers and agriculture experts on an hourly basis and transmit the collected data wirelessly to a central database or cloud platform for analysis using ML algorithms.Using ML algorithms to analyze the data, farmers and agriculture experts can obtain insights into the current state of the soil and predict future nutrient levels. Also the data here can then be used to make a conclusion about crop management practices such as fertilization, irrigation, and crop rotation. With the timely monitoring provided by smart agro devices, farmers can take preventive measures against soil nutrient deficiencies or excesses, leading to increased crop yields and better crop quality.In this study, smart agro devices with IoT sensors and ML algorithms offer a powerful tool for improving crop yields and producing healthy crops. By providing timely and accurate information on soil conditions, these devices can help farmers optimize crop management practices, contributing to the nationâ€™s economy and progress.
